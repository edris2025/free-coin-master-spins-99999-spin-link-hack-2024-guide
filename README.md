### Best Coin Master Tips to Maximize Your Free Spins

Now that you know where to find your free spins, let’s cover a few essential strategies to help you make the most of each spin.

---

#### 1. **Save Spins for Events**

Saving your spins can be a game-changer! Coin Master events often reward players with bonus spins, so it’s smart to stockpile your spins and use them during events to maximize your chances of winning big. Aim to have at least 500 spins saved up before any major event starts for the best rewards.

#### 2. **Use the Slot Machine Wisely**

The slot machine is where all the magic happens, but using it strategically is key. Try to **spin at the lowest level possible** when your primary goal is earning spins and coins rather than completing missions. Also, use spins in batches of five for better chances at hitting big rewards.

#### 3. **Don’t Miss Out on Shields**

Shields protect your village from attacks, and they can save you a ton of coins in the long run. Before spending your spins, try to stock up on shields. They’ll protect your assets and help you avoid costly rebuilds after a raid.

#### 4. **Maximize Rewards with Pets**

Coin Master’s pets—Foxy, Tiger, and Rhino—each provide unique benefits that can help you maximize rewards during gameplay. Activate your pet wisely; for example, use Tiger when raiding for additional rewards, and bring out Rhino when you’re trying to defend your village. Remember, pets need treats to stay active, so keep them fed!
